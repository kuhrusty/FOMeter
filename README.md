**WARNING: THIS APP CONTAINS FOUL LANGUAGE**

This dumb little app is for whipping out when people are saying something you
don't care about: press the screen, wait for the beeps to stop, and show them *quantitatively* how little you care.

...

*Of course* it's rigged: if the device has a gravity sensor, and the screen is tipped a little to the right, the measurement will be come out close to zero; otherwise, it'll come out close to one.  "I don't know, man; according to this, you *do* feel pretty strongly that men should wear capri pants."

(If the device has no gravity sensor, then it will look for a slight down-right swipe during the first half second or so.)

The green font is Blambot/Nate Piekos' TickingTimebombBB_ital.  The beep sounds
came from https://www.soundjay.com/beep-sounds-1.html; the low beep is Beep 7,
and the high beep is Beep 6.
