*(It got delisted again.)*

This dumb little app is for whipping out when people are saying
something you don't care about: press the screen, wait for the beeps to
stop, and show them *quantitatively* how little you care.

...

*Of course* it's rigged: if the device has a gravity sensor, and the
screen is tipped a little to the right, the measurement will be come out
close to zero; otherwise, it'll come out close to one.  "I don't know,
man; according to this, you *do* feel pretty strongly that men should
wear capri pants."

(If the device has no gravity sensor, or the gravity sensor is broken,
then it will look for a slight down-right swipe or roll of your finger
during the first half second or so.  If you miss that half-second
window, and see that the reading is continuing above one, then
"accidentally" lift your finger--causing it to stop and say "BAD
READ"--and try again.)

The green font is Blambot/Nate Piekos' TickingTimebombBB_ital.  The beep
sounds came from https://www.soundjay.com/beep-sounds-1.html; the low
beep is Beep 7, and the high beep is Beep 6.
